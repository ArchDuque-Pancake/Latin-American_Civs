Good day it is, Julio, you, unlike others, did great things for Argentina, a prideful nation with good prowess. Argentina came from the provinces of the 'de La Plata river', who broke free from Spain into their own path. Conquering the Mapuches, they expanded their territory, and after that, their economy grew more and more, until becoming one of the best in Latin America. Although not being very successful in war, Argentina today is stable and periodically good. =

Hail to the great emperor of Brazil, the great nation born from Portuguese and natives. The grand nation of Brazil was built upon the Portuguese use of slaves, but in difference with others, they integrated them into their culture, the Portuguese language.

Be welcomed, president. You lead the beautiful and rich nation of Colombia, a country with great cultural and biodiversity.\nThe attempts to break free got terribly punished,  but with unity and strength, Colombia managed independence with the help of Simon Bolivar, to later form his ambitious project of the Gran Colombia. Since the start we had a ton of great political division, which brought many, many problems and conflicts, but despite all the troubles, Colombia ought to help others, no matter what. The conflicts didn't cease until the early 21st century, where the sun finally rises over Colombia to achieve greatness. =

Ay! Greetings Mr. president. You lead the famous and cultured nation of Mexico. On the ruins of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, and on top of the lake, Mexico City stands on what was one of the empires crushed by the Spanish. A heroic independence did not give stability to the wonderful nation, as it's political conflict lead to many unfortunate events, but when it's needed Mexico unites against foreign aggressors and do the best they can. Even with internal struggles, and bad geography, Mexico is one of the most influential cultures of America. =

Mr. President, welcome.  As you know, you lead the great, ancient, cultural nation of the Peru. The nation dates back to the mighty Incas, after being colonized. The colony was one of the major ones for the Spanish - and that wasn't for no reason -. The ungrateful Spaniards wasted all the money, increased taxes, and combined with many other things, Peru rebelled. After a failed attempt, the joint effort of Simon Bolivar, and most importantly, San Martín, gave the freedom to the Peruvians, which continued to exploit their mineral riches, and culture abundance. =

Colonel Marcos Perez Jimenez, you have been a great disciplined, one who built this country. Its richness and beauty wonder many countries. The beautiful country born with the first settlers, warriors and fishermen. But our republican history starts when, Francisco de Miranda, a great excellent general, and Simon Bolivar, a Venezuelan strategist and fearless warrior, taking advantage of the weakened position of Spain would proclaim Venezuelan independence. The so dreamed independence would not come until the Battle of Carabobo, glory to the brave people, Venezuela has been born in Carabobo!, and the Venezuelan richness would have a rise in the middle of the 20th century, thanks to their resources. = 
Colonel! Your people call you, and express their affect, it's time to achieve what we have been waiting for years, it's time to bring back the glory that Venezuela deserves! Do you accept the challenge, your highness? Can you build a civilization that can stand the pass of time? =
